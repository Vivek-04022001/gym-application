# Notes of Nodejs

## Definitions

### **1. Node.js**:

Node.js is a powerful and flexible platform used to build server-side applications. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine that runs Google Chrome, allowing you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

**Key Points**:

- **JavaScript Runtime**: Node.js allows you to use JavaScript to write server-side code, enabling you to build full-stack applications using a single programming language.
- **Non-blocking, Asynchronous**: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which means it can handle many connections simultaneously without waiting for one task to complete before starting another. This makes it highly efficient for I/O-heavy operations like reading files or interacting with databases.
- **Modules**: Node.js has a vast library of modules available through npm (Node Package Manager), which you can use to add functionality to your applications without having to write everything from scratch.
- **Scalability**: Node.js is well-suited for building scalable network applications, such as web servers, APIs, and real-time applications like chat apps or live notifications.

**In Summary**:
Node.js is a platform that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side, making it possible to build fast, scalable, and efficient applications. It leverages an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model and has a rich ecosystem of modules to help you develop robust applications.

### 2. Important HTTP Status Codes for Backend Learning

#### Successful Responses (200–299)

- **200 OK**: Request was successful.
- **201 Created**: Resource was successfully created.
- **204 No Content**: Request was successful, but no content is returned.

#### Client Error Responses (400–499)

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid request syntax.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication required.
- **403 Forbidden**: Access denied.
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found.

#### Server Error Responses (500–599)

- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server encountered an error.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Server is currently unavailable.

### 3. Express.js Definition for Beginners

**Express.js**:

Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web servers and APIs. It provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.

**Key Points**:

- **Web Framework for Node.js**: Express.js helps you build web applications and APIs easily using Node.js.
- **Simplifies Server Creation**: It makes setting up a web server simple and straightforward, handling routes and HTTP requests effortlessly.
- **Middleware Support**: Express.js uses middleware to handle requests, which are functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the server.
- **Routing**: It provides a way to define routes to handle different URL paths and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Flexibility**: Express.js is unopinionated, meaning you have the freedom to structure your application the way you prefer.

**In Summary**:
Express.js is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Node.js that makes it easy to build web servers and APIs. It simplifies server creation, supports middleware, and provides routing capabilities, making it a go-to choice for many Node.js developers.
