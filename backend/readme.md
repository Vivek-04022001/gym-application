### Folder Explanations

1. **`config/`**:

   - **Purpose**: Contains configuration files for the application.
   - **Files**:
     - `db.js`: Database connection configuration (for future use when integrating a database).

2. **`controllers/`**:

   - **Purpose**: Holds the logic for handling incoming requests and sending responses.
   - **Files**:
     - `userController.js`: Handles user-related operations such as fetching user data and creating new users.
     - `authController.js`: Manages authentication processes like login and registration.
     - `classController.js`: Manages operations related to gym classes, such as creating and retrieving class information.
     - `bookingController.js`: Handles operations related to booking gym classes, such as making and viewing bookings.

3. **`data/`**:

   - **Purpose**: Contains mock data files used during the early stages of development.
   - **Files**:
     - `users.js`: Mock data for users.
     - `classes.js`: Mock data for gym classes.
     - `bookings.js`: Mock data for bookings.

4. **`middlewares/`**:

   - **Purpose**: Contains middleware functions that are executed during the request-response cycle.
   - **Files**:
     - `authMiddleware.js`: Middleware for handling authentication, ensuring that routes are protected and only accessible to authenticated users.

5. **`models/`**:

   - **Purpose**: Defines the database schemas and models using Mongoose (for future use when integrating a database).
   - **Files**:
     - `User.js`: Schema for the User model, defining the structure of user data.
     - `Class.js`: Schema for the Class model, defining the structure of gym class data.
     - `Booking.js`: Schema for the Booking model, defining the structure of booking data.

6. **`routes/`**:

   - **Purpose**: Contains route definitions that map to controller functions.
   - **Files**:
     - `userRoutes.js`: Defines routes for user-related operations.
     - `authRoutes.js`: Defines routes for authentication-related operations.
     - `classRoutes.js`: Defines routes for class-related operations.
     - `bookingRoutes.js`: Defines routes for booking-related operations.

7. **`utils/`**:
   - **Purpose**: Contains utility functions and helpers.
   - **Files**:
     - `errorHandler.js`: Custom error handler to manage application errors consistently.

### Root Files

- **`.env`**: Contains environment variables such as secret keys.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **`package.json`**: Lists the project dependencies and scripts.
- **`server.js`**: The entry point of the application. Sets up the Express server and connects to the database (or mock data).
- **`README.md`**: Provides documentation for the project.

This folder structure and file organization aim to maintain a clean and manageable codebase, ensuring that different aspects of the application are logically separated and easy to navigate. Using mock data in the `data` folder allows you to develop and test your application without the need for a database during the early stages.
